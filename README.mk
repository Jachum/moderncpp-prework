This is a prework repository for ModernCpp.


Please make yourself comfortable around C++14 by doing simple task of writing the body 
of method sumNumbersFromGenerators. Only the body need to be changed, everything else
is ok and will compile.

After correctly implementing the body of the function you should be able to compile 
and run the application.
